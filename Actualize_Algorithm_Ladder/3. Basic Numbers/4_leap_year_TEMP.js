// Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

/** Definition of a "leap year" in the Gregorian calendar :
 *  (your algorithm should account for) it occurs ...
    - on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
    - except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    - unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
    
    Ex: For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

    Note: If your language provides a method in the standard library that does this look-up, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.
