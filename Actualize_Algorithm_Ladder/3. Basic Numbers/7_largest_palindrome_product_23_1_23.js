// Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

/** Summary:
    - A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
    - The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

    - What do we need to do?
        > Take in a number (2, 3, etc), which will determine the length of both seed numbers
        > Return their palindromic product
    - Practically, what do we need to do?
        > Evaluate whether any product (the input, to start) is a palindrome
        > Set the max of both our numbers to highest "9"
    - What ?could? we do?
        > start with the two largest three-digit numbers (999 * 999) and see if they produce a palindrome
            -> incrementally-reduce the second number by 1 until we *do* get a palindrome
            -> store both the numbers & the palindrome

        ... I don't think there's a combo of two single digit numbers that creates a palindrome ... 22 is the lowest non-prime palindrome, and that'd take 2 * 11 ... a double-digit number
    - For two double digit numbers: 
        > 99 * 99 = 
    - I think we need to start with 99 (the largest two digit number) for both, and then decrement one until you get a palindrome
    - Once you get a palindrome, store the palindrom and the decremented number
    - Then, decrement the first number by 1 and repeat decrimenting of second until you hit that floor number - any palindromes should be compared to what's stored
