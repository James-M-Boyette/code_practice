# code_practice

### This is my Daily Deliberate Practice repo

#### In this repo, you will find the following:
- [ ] Data Structure-specific algorithm practice in Ruby
> First round is following the explicit instructions
>
> Second round will be producing algorithms in two or more formulations, for time (will time each and note results)
- [ ] Data Structure-specific algorithm practice in JS 
> ( One I have completed my first round of Ruby )
- [ ] Data Structure-specific algorithm practice in c++
> ( By this point, my expectation is to have ruby pretty firmly under my belt, and a reasonable understanding of JS ... so I want to start developing .exe / UE4 language skills )

- [ ] (Eventually) I will have particularly perplexing problems stored here as well
