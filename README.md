# code_practice
The short: Deciphering or Practicing coding concepts that are currently confusing me

The long: I want a repository online where I can both itteratively practice coding concepts and share/submit said work to my communities for constructive feedback.
In addition, I'm hoping this will further-incentivize me to do daily, deliberate practice (and show a record of any-such to others).
