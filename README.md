# code_practice (my Daily Deliberate Practice repo)

## What is it?
Here, I commit my near-daily deliberate practice. The sense of accomplishment it gives - especially when a project is progressing slowly - is ðŸ‘Œ. Also, just like my mother (a professional painter), this stuff atrophies if I don't keep it fresh. ðŸ˜©

#### Currently, I'm ...
- [x] Ruby
- [x] JavaScript
- [x] Use (and get more comfortable with) more complex methods (like `reduce()`) where possible
- [ ] Trying to learn how hash maps can be used in place of nested loops

#### In the future, I hope to ...
- [ ] Be able to complete an entire sheet in under 20 mins (in JS)
- [ ] Python
- [ ] C/C++/C#
