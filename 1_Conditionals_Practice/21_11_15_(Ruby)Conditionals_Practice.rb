# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.



# variable = 10



# if variable == 10



#   p "0"



# else



#   p "-1"



# end



# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.



# variable = 10.1



# if variable < 10



#   p -1



# elsif variable > 10



#   p 1



# elsif variable == 10



#   p 0



# else



#   p "something may be wrong"



# end



# 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.



# var1 = 4



# var2 = 9



# if var1 < 10 && var2 < 10



#   p 1



# else



#   p 0



# end



# 4. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise.



# var = 1000



# if var > 9000



#   p 1



# else



#   p -1



# end



# 5. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10, prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).



var = 38



# if var < 10



#   p 9



# elsif var < 20



#   p 19



# elsif var < 30



#   p 29



# else



#   p -1



# end



# 6. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 100 if either number is greater than 10, and prints -100 otherwise.



# var1 = 9



# var2 = 8



# if var1 > 10 || var2 > 10



#   p 100



# else



#   p -100



# end



# 7. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1776 if the number is less than 0, and prints 1979 otherwise.



# var = -1777



# if var < 0



#   p 1776



# else



#   p 1979



# end



# 8. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 100 if the number equals 100, prints 99 if the number is equal to 99, and prints 0 otherwise.



# var = 99



# if var == 100



#   p 100



# elsif var == 99



#   p 99



# else



#   p 0



# end



# 9. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the first number is less than zero and the second number is greater than 0, and prints 0 otherwise.



# var1 = -1



# var2 = 2



# if var1 < 0 && var2 > 0



#   p 1



# else



#   p 0



# end



# 10. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 5 if the number is greater than 80, prints 4 if the number is greater than 60, prints 3 if the number is greater than 40, prints 2 if the number is greater than 20, and prints 1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).



# var = -21



# if var > 80



#   p 5



# elsif var > 60



#   p 4



# elsif var > 40



#   p 3



# elsif var > 20
